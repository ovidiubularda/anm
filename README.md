# Rinf - Technical Challenge

A simple application made with angujarjs, nodejs and mongodb.

### Description ###

Using Angular.js, make a web app that fulfills these user stories:

* I want to view a list of products.
* I want to view a single product.
* I want to comment on a product.
* I want to view other comments when I view a product.
* I want to create a product with a name, description, and price (assume USD).
* Communicate with HTTP to a backend. (Note: can be mocked for this exercise - use ngMockE2E and
$httpBackend)
* Structure your code sanely. Use directives, services, controllers, etc. where appropriate.

OPTIONAL BONUS POINTS:
* Build the backend using node.js - if you use loopback.io or another set of CRUD generators, it should be a
breeze.
* Persist the product/comment data to an actual database. (You could just store the data in memory for this
exercise)

### How to run the app ###

1. Navigate to the anm folder
2. run in console node .
